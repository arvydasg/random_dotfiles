# Dotfiles

Various dotfiles from differnet periods..

* (early 2021) All excited. Everything is new. Started with Vim + DWM window manager on Linux Ubuntu.

* (mid 2021) Manjaro + tmux.. then Arch Linux.

* (mid 2021) Discovered and was sold by Emacs. Hardcore user.. Org mode, Latex documents, coding tasks.. all my life at this point was INSIDE Emacs.

* (Late 2021) Switched to making websites/shops with Wordpress, thats why it was quiet here.

* (begining 2022) Installed Emacs once again on both Linux (for programming - I enjoy not touching the mouse) and Windows (forced to use it for Lightroom, Premiere, Revit and many other programs that I have been used for Years for work)

After Installing emacs on Windows once again (2022-01-03), I decided I need to put my emacs documentation in one place. "Usable Emacs" folder is just for that. Some documentation there as well.
