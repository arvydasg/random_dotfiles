first of  all - choose non free drivers, cuz of nividia drivers that I have. hope it will solve the problem with the dwm and random screen freezes + tags not working...

IMMEADITELY AFTER INSTALL


htop check - 650M/7.60G 73tasks 143thr
sensors check 54

firewall - on

go to updates - update everything that is there (matcha gtk theme this time.. ikd)

3 dots in the same window -> preferences

official repositories -> refresh mirrors list (3-10mins)

AUR -> enable aur support, keep build packages in cache, check for updates

manjaro settings manager -> hardware configuration to see the drivers. graphic drivers preferably shoul be alright. google idk.. this time wont do anything.


INSTALLING TIMESHIFT

install timeshift through the package downloader gui
go through the wizard, make sure to set the location of the timeshifts to the home folder

maybe set daily 1?

root - include all fles
home - include hidden files only

make one timeshift copy BEFORE installing all the other apps and changes.

sudo pacman -S dmenu

installing/making it

##################### CUZTOMIZING ########################

vim plugins
brave vimium
st terminal (line, font, colors)

install image viewer (through the shop, smalles one possible)


print dwm commands
print vim commands
print linux commands
print vimium commands


##################### PRINTING  ########################


install cups for printing. (through the shop)
run ./install.sh from the drivers, hopefully also on github.
https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Printing
follow first steps from that tutorial or just do:
pamac install manjaro-printer (chose nothing)
sudo gpasswd -a aze sys
sudo systemctl enable --now cups.service
and go to cups and do a test page
it works!!

try write in terminal:
lp filename or
lpr filename

see if prints. if doest, then do this command
lpstat -p -d
if says there is no destination set, do this:
Your printer should have a name of some sort -- say, InkJet or something similar -- defined in CUPS. In CUPS (http://localhost:631), click on Printers, then click on the name of the printer. Then click on Administration and finally, click on Set as Server Default. Exit CUPS.

restart computer, do this command again, should be fine.

fuck I made it work. now write lp filename and it prints!!! wow man. :)



##################### WIFI  ########################

type nmtui
and choose connection



################### DWM bg image ###################

first lets create a patch for dwm that on every autostart will look for an image and set it up, later we will use the same autostart patch to make the status bar thingy.

go to dwm folder, make this file:
dwm-autostart-20161205-bb3bd6f.diff

go to this link
https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/
then copy the patch code of the first file, named same like you just created and paste the contents into your file.
good.

now in dwm folder do sudo make clean uninstall
then patch --merge -i dwm-autostar and tab to finish
enter

will write that it has been installed.
then we make sudo make clean install again.

now lets make a .dwm folder, in which dwm will look for autostart.sh file every time it is booted.

mkdir .dwm
vim autostart.sh
write
#! /bin/bash

feh --bg-scale ~/pics/sunsetdunes.jpg
:wq
sudo chmod +x autostart.sh
./autostart.sh
and the background should be set.
change the image to see the effect and the script working. so cool dude first bash script.


################### DWM admin bar ###################

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz0rd7_8tf0
this video.

sudo pacman -S xorg
xsetroot -name "hello" - puts hello into the bar.

go to .dwm
vim autostart.sh
then add
while true; do
        xsetroot -name "$(date)
        sleep 1s
done

set up aliases for terminal cd .. some cool things, just like the hobyist
