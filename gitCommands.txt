git init (turning a repository into a git repository. good for starting from computer not from web)

git remote add origin https://github.com/arvygasp/githhub.git
git remote -v (shows all the origins)


git status (see the files)
git config --list (some info about you)

git commit -a is enough when you are just editing one file... when you edit tens of files and you want to upload only 3 of them, then you do git add (those 3 files) and then do git commit, then only thoes 3 files will get commited I think. Adding is just putting those files into the STAGING AREA, and only those files will be actually comitted.

git commit -a(all the changes, not necessary) -m "adding new files bla" (do this, to put the files into a magic box)

git add . (. means all or choose specific files)

git status (check the files)

git log - (see the commits you made (can go back and forth between commits here like the guy in the video))

git pull origin master



git remote add origin https://github.com/arvygasp/githhub.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
