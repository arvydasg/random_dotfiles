git init (turning a repository into a git repository. good for starting from computer not from web)

git remote add origin https://github.com/arvygasp/githhub.git
git remote -v (shows all the origins)


git status (see the files)
git config --list (some info about you)

git commit -a is enough when you are just editing one file... when you edit tens of files and you want to upload only 3 of them, then you do git add (those 3 files) and then do git commit, then only thoes 3 files will get commited I think. Adding is just putting those files into the STAGING AREA, and only those files will be actually comitted.

git commit -a(all the changes, add them all and commit them. useful for 99% of the time) -m "adding new files bla" (do this, to put the files into a magic box)

if you have new files you can not just commit -a, you need to add those files into the staging area  with "git add" first and then commit.

git add . (. means all or choose specific files)

git status (check the files)

git log - (see the commits you made (can go back and forth between commits here like the guy in the video))
git branch - (check whihc branch you are on) 
git log 
git status (see what branch)
git remote (see what remote you are on) 

git push origin master

git status (GOOD PRECAUTION to make sure nothing is left out) 
git pull origin master



git remote add origin https://github.com/arvygasp/githhub.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

STARTING A REPO ON A COMPUTER

git init
now you can do git add, git status and all
but you can not push the changes, why?
try to do git remote -v -- you get nothing
it doesnt have a remote, you have to go to gihub and create an empty repo with NO readme.
git remote add origin(rainbox, kakadu, bet ka, bet origin is convention, origin web server version of this repo) https://bla bla.... copy the url 
now do git remote
git remote -v
git push origin master 
great

now try to go on github and make a change.
go back to the computer and do git status
should tell you that your dir is missing the changes.
git pull origin master - to pull the changes you made on github back to your computer's dir
